This is my new project, "Hello, World in 1001 programming langauges". The idea of this program is to introducing almost every programming langauge, with "Hello World" program example,
because I mean, that is the first code every beginner programmer ever runs. I do not know if something similiar exists, but anyways...this would be massive project. 

Currently, there are 113 top programming languages, and work is still in progress, updates will be placed every week. Please, note that this project is not stable on mobiles yet.
I hope it would be intresting:
